#
Level Editor File Format
-------------------------------
The hash symbol starts and ends a comment block and everything within is ignored by the parser.
New lines and tabs are counted as whitespace, all whitespace has the same meaning.
Consecutive white space is condensed into a single whitepspace character.

<T> <- Tag begin
</T> <- Tag end

"string" <- Strings are contained within "", some tags expect a string
Some tags expect multiple values, these values are seperated by ','.
Some tags expect vectors, vectors are inside {}

#

#
Level Header Starts with the <H> Tag
This contains data about the actual map.
#
<H>
	# The internal name of the level, as refered to by campaign files. #
	<name> "tutorial_1" </name>

	# The display name of the level, as shown to the user. #
	<display_name> "Baby Steps" </display_name>

	# Number of beacons required to complete level. #
	<min_beacons> 1 </min_beacons>

</H>

#
Blocks are specified with the <bl> tag.
#
<bl>
